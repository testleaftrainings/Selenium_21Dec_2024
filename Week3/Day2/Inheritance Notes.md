### Inheritance:

1. **Definition of Inheritance**: 
    - Inheritance is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit attributes and behaviors (methods) from another class. 
    - This uses `extends` keyword 

2. **Advantages of Inheritance**:
   - **Reusability**: Inheritance promotes the reuse of existing code without having to rewrite it.
   - **Readability**: It makes the code more simple by establishing clear relationships between classes.
   - **Hierarchy**: Establishes parent-child relationships between Classes and Interfaces, making the structure easier to understand and maintain.

3. **Types of Inheritance**:
   - **Single**: A class inherits from one parent class.
   - **Multiple**: A class inherits behaviors from more than one class, typically achieved through interfaces in Java.
   - **Multilevel**: A class inherits from a child class, creating a multilevel chain.
   - **Hierarchical**: Multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.
   - **Hybrid**: A combination of multilevel and hierarchical inheritance.

4. **Java Examples**:
    - Integer extends Number
    - RuntimeException extends Exception
    - List extends Collection
   
5. **Selenium WebDriver Examples**:
        - ChromeDriver extends ChromiumDriver
        - EdgeDriver extends ChromiumDriver
        - ChromiumDriver extends RemoteWebDriver
